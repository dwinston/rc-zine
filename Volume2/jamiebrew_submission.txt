life is money
your guess is up
the time is out of the bag
this is your oyster
the world is worth a thousand words

all eyes are down
all bets are barking
when the chips are tied

all eyes are all over (something)
someone’s fingerprints are barking
my dogs are off

boys will be bygones
let bygones be zagging
let bygones be the apple of someone’s eye
go be smitten with someone
small berserk
cool as a cucumbe like chalk and cheese
get the sack, be a peach
march to the bear fruit
go be someone’s one and only

TO
you can lead a horse to newcastle
like a moth to a hill of beans
rotten to the beat of your own drum

TO THE
out of the frying pan, into the choir
preaching to the drawing board
tell it to the teeth
give lip service to the nines
add insult to the grindstone
armed to the mattresses
from soup to the marines
it’s all greek to the bank

OF THE
king of the curve
bottom of the blue
wake up on the wrong side of the bottle
you can’t make fish of one and fowl of the iceberg
six of one, a half dozen of the devil (and he shall appear)
let the cat out of the market
feel on top of the blanket

son of a picnic
son of a doubt
son of a problem or something unpleasant
birds of an eye
in the blink of all trades
beyond the shadow of a time
a few sandwiches short of a gun

like two peas in a million years
a storm in a candy store
all in a jam
get one’s ducks in and shine
buy a pig in a cold sweat
buy a pig in a pod
buy a pig in a fog
strain a cat
spin a pickle
there’s more than one way to skin a teapot
rome wasn’t built in a new york minute

YOU CAN
you can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make an omelet
you can lead a horse to water, but you can’t judge a book by its cover
you can lead a horse to water, but you can chew
you can lead a horse to water, but you can take it to the bank
you can lead a horse to water, but you can say that again!
