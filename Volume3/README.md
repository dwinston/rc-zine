This Thanksgiving, expect no menu. You will get served… What you deserve.

In other words…the Zine is back!

Calling all RCers (current and alum) to send us what you reap, send us what you sow, send us kernels as though we were pigeons snacking and you were the kind neighbor down the street, for the theme of this Zine is….

**Reap What You Sow: It’s Kernels All The Way Down**

You can interpret this theme in any way you want (or ignore it completely)! If you’re curious about what our past Zines looked like, check out [Aidan’s zinepage](https://zine.recurse.com).

The deadline to upload a submission (via pull request to this folder) is **Monday, November 18th** at 5pm and just remember…

The road to hell is paved with things you meant to submit to the zine… But really this Zine cannot be possible without the submissions of the community <3 <3 <3 <3

Love, The RC Zine
