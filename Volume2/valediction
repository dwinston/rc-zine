A Valediction: Forbidding Boring 
(with apologies to John Donne)

As recursive friends neâ€™er graduate away,
   And whisper to their souls to go,
Whilst some of their sad friends do stay
   The rest go now, and some say, No:

So let us code, and make no bugs,
   No overflows, nor type errors raise;
In costumes dress, and drink, go nuts,
   To tell the leaving ones our praise.

To look for jobs brings fears and doubts,
   we deal with anxiousness and stress;
But to play it small or count us out,
   Though tempting, sure, it yields far less.

Rust or Lisp or shaders love
   (Whose soul is sense) cannot admit
Arrays, because they do remove
   Those things which elemented it.
